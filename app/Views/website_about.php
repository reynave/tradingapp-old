                        Back in 2016 a group of programmers and trader decide to trade with AI. Quickly we found
                        that no
                        matter
                        how many trading courses we took, we couldn’t be profitable. We simply just didn’t know what we
                        were
                        going
                        right or wrong.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is when we decided we needed a tool to track closely our trades. We started tracking our
                        trades
                        on
                        an
                        excel sheet. Our needs quickly grew and the excel sheets were no longer reasonable to keep, as
                        they
                        needed
                        more features for us to get useful feedback out of them.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        We needed more information, and we wanted to concentrate just on trading not in improving our
                        excel
                        sheets.
                        That is when we gather as a team and we decided to create Mirrel.com.

                    <p>
                        Now a day Mirrel.com is the most complete trade journal in the market supported by thousands of
                        traders
                        looking to track their trades closely with the minimum effort
                    </p>
